#Ghost Theme
Ghost Theme is a minimalistic [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) theme inspired by
KISS, which is inspired by [Phantom](https://github.com/Bartinger/phantom), which is inspired by casper.

## Features

## SEO

Then follow the steps mentioned [here](http://support.ghost.org/edit-ghost-theme/).

If you want to set it as your new ghost theme, click `Download ZIP` on the
right of this page and then follow
[these steps](http://support.ghost.org/upload-theme-ghostpro/).

**Note:** Make sure you modify all my personal stuff, such as:
- Social links
- Google Analytics tracking code ([sign
  up](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=analytics&userexp=signup&hl=en)
  and they will provide the whole new JS code)
- Twitter handle in default.hbs
- Static pages in page-projects.hbs
